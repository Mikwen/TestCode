# TestCode
Test code for school project
It's not connected to the newest code, but extremely close to it. 
Since I did not know how to write unit codes and I got help from a friend who only knew how to do it in linux, the code for the tests are written in linux instead of windows. Given more time I would have written it so that it worked in windows, but our group pushed a very heavy work load pretty close to the deadline and we had to prioritize getting a runnable product over getting a working test code that covers 70% of our code in another software.

This is of course not the best solution but I hope it is alright for now.
